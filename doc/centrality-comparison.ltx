Let $f$ be a function that accepts a graph with $n$ vertices as input and returns a vector of length $n$ measuring the centralities of centralities of the vertices of the graph. Let $k$ be a number of vertices to remove. 

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Method 1.} Remove the $k$ vertices of $G$ with the $k$ highest values in $f(G)$. If there are ties, choose randomly among the lowest-scoring vertices.

\medskip

\noindent {\bf Method 2.} Let $v$ be the vertex with the highest value in $f(G)$; if there are ties choose one of the highest-scoring vertices at random. Remove $v$ from $G$ and apply the method to $G \backslash v$. Repeat the process until $k$ vertices have been removed.

\bigskip

These methods were evaluated using two graphs: the karate social network graph (\url{https://networkrepository.com/soc-karate.php}) and a football network (\url{http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/}), and using spread and eigenvector centrality measures. The karate graph has 34 vertices and 156 edges; 17 vertices were selected for removal. The football graph has 115 vertices and 613 edges; 57 vertices were selected for removal.

\section*{Method 1 results}

Table \ref{m1-table} shows the largest eigenvalue of the remaining graph after the vertices selected by Method 1 have been removed. The final values for the two centrality measures for the karate graph are identical; however they did not remove exactly the same vertices. Specifically, there were two vertices removed for each measure that were not removed for the other.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
Centrality measure & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Karate} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Football} \\ \hline
Spread             & 2.48                       & 9.06                         \\
Eigenvector        & 2.48                       & 9.09                        
\end{tabular}
\caption{Method 1 results}
\label{m1-table}
\end{table}

\section*{Method 2 results}

Table \ref{m2-table} shows the largest eigenvalue of the remaining graph after the vertices selected by Method 2 have been removed. The final value for the karate graph is the minimum possible value for a graph with at least one edge.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
Centrality measure & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Karate} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Football} \\ \hline
Spread             & 1.00                       & 4.14                         \\
Eigenvector        & 1.85                       & 4.05                        
\end{tabular}

Figure \ref{method-2-karate-figure} shows the largest eigenvalue of the remaining graph at each step of execution of Method 2 for the karate graph, using both centrality measures. The values do not differ until six vertices have been removed.

Figure \ref{method-2-football-figure} shows the largest eigenvalue of the remaining graph at each step of execution of Method 2 for the football graph, using both centrality measures. The value from using spread centrality is lower than the value from using eigenvector centrality in 13 of the 57 iterations.
