# disease-sim - A simple Python simulation of disease progression

This project contains code for a simple disease progression simulation that is
designed to begin with a graph indicating connections between people and some
other initial state (such as which people are vaccinated and who is "patient 0")
variables, and then simulates how a disease progresses through the network,
given specific values of _p<sub>s</sub>_ and _p<sub>d</sub>_.
